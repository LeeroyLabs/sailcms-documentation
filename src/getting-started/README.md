# Introduction

SailCMS is a PHP CMS focused on 3 things, be very fast, developer friendly and extensible. Version 3 achieves these
goals and more. This document will hopefully help you on your way to becoming a SailCMS developer, otherwise known
as a Sailor (ok, probably not).

This documentation tries to explain as much as possible and show as many examples as possible for you to have a terrific
time using this CMS.

With all of that nice stuff said, we are assuming a few things in this documentation.

1. You are super comfortable with PHP
2. You have a experience with Composer
3. You have a good understanding of the PSR-4 standard and the MVC Architecture
4. You know MongoDB (eventually we will support MySQL/MySQL-like servers)
