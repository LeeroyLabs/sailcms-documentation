# Working With Sail

Working with Sail is made easy with the sail CLI tool. You can create many of the boilerplate code with it. See 
`Working with the CLI` for more details about working with it.

After installing Sail, you can start extending it with new features. Everything is wrapped using `Containers`.
See the [Containers section](/working-with-sail/containers) for more details.
