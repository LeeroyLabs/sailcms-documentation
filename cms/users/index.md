# Users <Badge type="tip" text="3.0.0" />

As with any good cms, SailCMS offers users, roles and permissions out of the box. You can extend those with custom roles
and permissions. Please see the [Roles and Permissions](/working-with-sail/roles-acl) section.

## Special Note

SailCMS offers multisite support. Every content and category belongs to each site, but not users. Users are
site-agnostic. Normally, the multisite feature is used for the same site that would present different content and/or 
layout in different regions or something of that nature.
